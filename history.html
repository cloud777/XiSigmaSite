    <p class="lead text-center mb-5">
      The Xi Sigma Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc. was founded with a mission to uplift, inspire, and lead. Since its inception, our chapter has continued to make an impact both on and off campus through service, leadership, and brotherhood.

    <p>
      The brothers of Xi Sigma have upheld the four cardinal principles: Manhood, Scholarship, Perseverance, and Uplift. Our history is built on a legacy of excellence, community engagement, and academic achievement.
    </p>

    <p>
      From campus events to community service initiatives, Xi Sigma continues to be a guiding light of leadership and purpose. Our alumni have gone on to succeed in diverse fields and remain committed to mentoring the next generation of brothers.
